# Find usages plugin

## Update: Did not know about the find in files option built into godot, kinda redundant with that...

Initially wanted to make a plugin similar to android studio's find usages plugin but felt using the external editor -> VSCode is good enough for searching instances...

To use it, just enable the plugin after downloading the folder to addons
